# Tree-Counter
Counts trees by looking at high quality drone imagery using deep neural networks

Uses MlpClassifier for neural network


trained on 200 25*25 pixel images of trees then classifys every pixel in main image.

To run your self
1. Place 50 pictures of trees that are 25*25 pixels in the "Good" directory
2. Place 150 pictures of things that are 25*25 pixels and not trees in the "Bad" directory
3. Place all images to be queued up in the ready directory
